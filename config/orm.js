// ***5
//create an object with some really basic CRUD methods that use connection.query() to query the database
//at the very least we need to be able to Create burgers, Update burgers (true or false eaten column) and Read burgers to get the list

//example:
const orm = {
	selectAll: function(tablename) {
		//uses the tablename in a SELECT * FROM <tablename> query
		// video of saturday the 29th of sat;
	}
};
